  Description:
    The variable `r` is used inconsistently in the branches of an if statement. In one branch it is consumed while in the other it is not yet consumed.
  Code:
     6 |     function main(): ExitCode is
     7 |         let r: R := R(x => 32);
     8 |         if true then
     9 |             let { x: Int32 } := r;
    10 |         else
    11 |             skip;
    12 |         end if;
    13 |         return ExitSuccess();
    14 |     end;
