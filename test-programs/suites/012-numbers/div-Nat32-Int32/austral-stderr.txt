  Description:
    Both operands to an arithmetic expression must be compatible types. The LHS has type `Nat32` but the RHS has type `Int32`.
  Code:
    3 |         let a: Nat32    := 10;
    4 |         let b: Int32    := 20;
    5 |         let c: Nat32    := a * b;
    6 |         return ExitSuccess();
    7 |     end;
