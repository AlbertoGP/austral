    Both operands to an arithmetic expression must be compatible types. The LHS has type `Int64` but the RHS has type `Index`.
  Code:
    3 |         let a: Int64    := 10;
    4 |         let b: Index    := 20;
    5 |         let c: Int64    := a * b;
    6 |         return ExitSuccess();
    7 |     end;
