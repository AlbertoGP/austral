Error:
  Title: Declaration Error
  Module:
    Test
  Location:
    [no span available]
  Description:
    The type parameters in a generic instance declaration cannot have the same name as the type parameter in the corresponding typeclass. The colliding name is `A` 
    
     This is, regrettably, a load-bearing hack for https://github.com/austral/austral/issues/244. Fixing this properly would require rewriting large parts of the frontend.
