  Description:
    Cannot borrow the variable `foo` because it is already borrowed (read-only).
  Code:
    10 |         borrow foo as fooref in rho do
    11 |             -- Borrow it again.
    12 |             borrow foo as fooref2 in rho2 do
    13 |                 skip;
    14 |             end;
    15 |         end;
    16 |         -- Consume the record by destructuring.
